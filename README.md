 Adds the time you've worked for based on your hourly wage to the end of each price on amazon(all countries' websites)



->This extension utilizes real-time exchange rate data from ExchangeRate-API to convert prices to the user's preferred currency.

To limit the amount of API calls I have added a cache system which refreshes in two days. You can edit that depending on you API's capabilities/pricing.
